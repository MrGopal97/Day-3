What is the difference between window, screen, and document in Javascript?

Definitions:

Window

The Window interface represents a window containing a DOM document,the document property points to the DOM document loaded in that window.

A window for a given document can be obtained using the document.defaultView property.

Screen

The Screen interface represents a screen, usually the one on which the current window is being rendered, and is obtained using window.screen

Document

The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree.

So to understand the difference let us understand the flow!

The window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser. This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.
